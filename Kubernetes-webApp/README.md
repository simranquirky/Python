# Kubernetes-WebApp
This web app provides a graphical interface for running kubernetes commands

# Languages used
- html
- css
- javascript
- python

# Aim
The main focus of this app is to help newbies get comfortable with kubernetes, as the process gets automated , all u need to do is a single click and the pods get launched, resources gets deleted and much more. The project is at the starting stage of its build so I have integrated 6-7 commands automation only. In case u want to do something other than this you will have to simply type in the command in others section.
We have used ajax to display the code output in the same page.

# Working of the app
-takes input from html page
-takes it to python-cgi backend
-runs required task and returns output
-output grabbed by js and displayed in the same html page
